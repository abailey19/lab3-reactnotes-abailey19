## CS 52, Lab 3: React Notes

### The lab
For this lab, I created an online noteboard that allows users to create, edit, move, and delete post-it-like notes with Markdown formatting. Something that helped me a lot for this lab was sketching things out: the app screen and its components, and how props and callbacks moved between them. This was especially helpful with firebase. I spent a while trying to figure out what the state was at each moment and when it was getting updated from the database, and pausing to sketch this out helped.

### Extra credit
Z-Index: I kept a maximum z-index value in my app state and used it to make a note pop to the front of all other notes when it was dragged or its edit button was clicked.

Firebase auth: Users can log in to view their separate note boards. Login with username cs52@test.com and password 123456 to view my board, or create your own account!
